# Release Notes

## ACSE 1.2.4

Released on 2023-09-15

- Simplify handling of scalar variables.
- Remove all functions declarations without a prototype, fix some incorrect
  prototypes.

## ACSE 1.2.3

Released on 2021-12-15

- Fixed a bug in ACSE where multiple assignments of the same label did not
  generate an error.
- Fixed a bug in the assembler where multiple definitions of the same label did
  not generate an error.
- In the assembler, return a non-zero code from `main()` in case of error.
- Minor corrections to the comments in ACSE.

## ACSE 1.2.2

Released on 2021-12-13

## ACSE 1.2.1

Released on 2021-09-13

### New Features

- Now almost every header file in acse has a comment describing its purpose.
- Strings passed to `yyerror()` are now displayed rather than discarded.
- Improved formatting of the acse logs and the assembly printout.
- Changed file extension of the acse logs to `.log` from `.cfg` and `.out`.

  `gen_bcs_instruction()`, and `gen_bgt_instruction()` functions.
- Acse no longer crashes when the source code contains a division by zero in a
  constant expression.
- Fixed semantics of the `.SPACE` assembler directive to take a number of words
  rather than a number of bytes.

  segment of executables.

## ACSE 1.2.0

Released on 2020-09-14

### New Features

**Changes to acse:**

- The logical `NOT` operator (!) now supports expression arguments.
- Added clang-format and editorconfig files for automatic configuration of
  indentation and linting in several editors.
- The debug dump files and the compiled assembly now contains comments that map
  the instructions to the line in the source code that produced them.
- Labels corresponding to variables are now named like the variable in dump
  files and the compiled assembly.
- `collections`: added new `addBefore()` and `addAfter()` functions for adding
  an element before or after a given element in a list in O(1) time.
- `collections`: added new macros (`INTDATA`, `LINTDATA` and `SET_INTDATA`) for
  simplifying the use of the list data pointer as an integer.
- `axe_engine`: added new functions `newNamedLabel()` and
  `assignNewNamedLabel()` to create labels with a personalized name. 
- It is now possible to use immediates of any size (not restricted to 16 bits
  anymore) when generating instructions with immediate operands (`ADDI`, `SUBI`,
  `MULI`...)
- Add a new debug output file named `frontend.out` containing the state of the
  IR just after parsing, before any transformation takes place.
- acse now prints the version number on startup.
- Added support for computing def/use of the PSW (flags) register, as a
  debugging aid (the PSW register now appears in `dataflow.cfg`)
- Debug files are now flushed more frequently to ensure complete logs in case
  of crashes.
- Documentation improvements (fixed typos and grammar mistakes, clarified
  descriptions of some functions)
- Other API additions for internal use.

**Changes to mace:**

- Implemented `JSR` and `RET` instructions.
- Add a new instruction (`XPSW`) which exchanges the value of the PSW register
  with the value of a general-purpose register.
- When compiling mace with `DEBUG` enabled, fflush `stderr` at every instruction
  executed to ensure complete logs in case of crashes.
- Added a verification tool to use for regression testing. It can be executed
  by running `make verify` inside the mace directory.
- All comments written in Italian were replaced by comments written in English.
- Minor improvements to the debug features.

**Changes to asm:**

- Comments are now allowed anywhere in assembly language sources (previously
  they were allowed only after an instruction)
- Added support for hexadecimal immediates in the form `0x[0-9A-Za-z]+`
- Added support for inserting multiple data words within the same `.WORD`
  directive (syntax: `.WORD <word_1> <word_2> ... <word_n>`)

**Changes to tests:**

- Renamed syntax error tests to more descriptive names.

**Other changes:**

- Code formatting improvements across the entire project.
- Improvements to the makefiles:
  - All makefiles can now use the standard configuration variables `CFLAGS`,
    `YFLAGS` (bison), `LFLAGS` (flex) and `LDFLAGS`.
  - The test makefile now rebuilds the tests when Acse has changed.
  - Changed the test makefile to be whitespace-friendly.
  - Other improvements

### Bug Fixes

**Changes to acse:**

- `handle_bin_numeric_op` now supports all binary operations used in `Acse.y`.
- Fixed `gen_move_immediate` and `gen_load_immediate` to properly handle
  positive numbers larger than 32767 with bit 15 set.
- Fix a bug where an initialized variable was not properly loaded if it was
  used and defined exactly once by the same instruction in the first basic
  block.
- Fix a bug where invalid tokens after a valid statement caused parsing to stop
  mid-program without an error.
- Fix a bug where line numbers were incorrectly counted on lines with C++ style
  comments.
- Fix a bug in register allocation materialization where spill store
  instructions were placed one instruction too early in basic blocks without an
  explicit terminator instruction.
- Fixed a bug where the register allocator would unexpectedly run out of spill
  registers because the liveness of registers allocated to RD operands was not
  tracked correctly.
- Handle `RET` instructions like `HALT` instructions when performing analysis
  passes.
- Properly generate a `NEG` instruction instead of a `SUB` instruction in
  `gen_neg_instruction`.
- Properly return `SY_LOCATION_UNSPECIFIED` from `getLocation()` even when
  `errorcode` is `NULL`.
- Removed unused tokens deriving from incomplete implementations of old exams
  (`MOD_OP`, `FOR`, `COLON`).
- Fix several minor uninitialized memory accesses in exceptional situations.
- Other improvements

**Changes to mace:**

- Fix a bug where the carry flag is set incorrectly after `SHR`/`SHRI`
  instructions.
- Fix a bug where the carry flag is set incorrectly after `SUB`/`SUBI`
  instructions.
- Fix a bug where the overflow flag is set incorrectly after `MUL`/`MULI`
  instructions with specific operands (i.e. `-2147483648 * -1` did not set the
  overflow flag even though it should have)
- Do not set the carry flag after `MUL` instructions.
- Do not crash when performing the specific division `INT_MIN / -1`.
- Fix a bug where the carry flag is set incorrectly after `SHL` and `SHR` when
  the shift amount is zero (it should have been reliably set to zero, instead
  it was undefined behavior).
- Fix behavior of `ROTR` when shift amount is zero.
- Ensure that `SUB` and `NEG` instructions set flags in the same way.
- Other improvements (code cleanup)

**Changes to asm:**

- Fixed a bug where `asm` would crash if `findLabel` is called with incorrect
  arguments.

**Other changes:**

- Fixed several bugs involving expressions with negative numbers, which were
  caused by a mismatch between signedness conventions of acse and mace.
- Makefiles: updated the list of tests (removed a duplicate, added a missing
  test)
